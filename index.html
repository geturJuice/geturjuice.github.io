  <h1>Mac O'Callaghan</h1>
  <h2>My name is MacGregor O'Callaghan I recently graduated from high school and am love to explore the arts and how people communicate through art aswell in evry day life. So naturaly the internet is an important part of that in moder culture. With college not being on the top of my list I looked for methods that would allow me to jump more directly into a feild that I know I would enjoy for years to come. I am an avid gamer mostly of the game DotA 2 and love the culture and intesety of the community it show how humans have a natural drive to compete and strive to be the best they can be at what they do. My experience in programing and development began when I got into high school and began to look to my future to see what I would like to be doing in a couple of years to support myself. Through this exploration I found the computer sciences, I began to look into this new evolving feild and found programing and all the amazing things it was capable of doing so I myself began to try and learn how I could be a part of this new age of creation. I leanred the basics of Java and C++ because they seemed to be what was good to know. As I continued throught high school I leanred more about the world and explored other aspects of the world that intrueged me. In the end I came back to programming because I saw it as a very powerful piece of knowledge that I could utilize to express myself and be part of something that is changing the world as we know it.
